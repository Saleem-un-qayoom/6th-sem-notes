Characteristics of software project management

When requirements are changed and new requirements are added to the project later, project management team can compare the new schedule with the baseline schedule automatically to understand the project scope and cost deviations.


3.Issue tacking:- During the project life cycle, there can be many issues related to project that needs constant tracking and monitoring. software defects is one of the good examples for this.
